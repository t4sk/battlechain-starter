///         The attack flow:
///           1. Register a transfer hook on MockToken so this contract gets a callback on receive
///           2. Deposit seed tokens to establish a non-zero balance in the vault
///           3. Call withdrawAll() — vault transfers tokens, triggering our hook
///           4. Inside onTokenTransfer(), call withdrawAll() again (balance still non-zero)
///           5. Repeat until the vault is empty
///           6. You're on BattleChain — split the haul per Safe Harbor terms and walk away clean
///
/// Prerequisites — set in .env:
///   TOKEN_ADDRESS, VAULT_ADDRESS, RECOVERY_ADDRESS
///
/// Usage:
///   forge script script/Attack.s.sol --rpc-url battlechain --broadcast
